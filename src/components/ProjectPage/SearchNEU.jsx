          <div>Goal: Create class cards that show the most vital information with visual hierarchy. Shorten search time by making it easier for students to quickly compare courses.
            <br/><br/>
            What kind of course information are most important to students when comparing courses? Based on user research conducted by past designers, most students want to see the number of sections available, how many credits a course is worth, and the NUPath requirements that the course fulfills. 
            
            <div class={styles.imgLeft}>
              <img class={styles.cards} src= "assets/search/cards.png"></img>
              <div>
              We created multiple iterations in an attempt to determine the best format. One of our challenges was trying not to overload the card with too much dense information, and deciding whether or not some elements needed to be omitted to free up space.
              <br/><br/>
              By using font weight (contrast) and color, we were able to include all elements in our final prototype. Now, students can see a lot more course information at first glance!
